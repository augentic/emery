Emery reconciles intent, documentation, existing code, and captured behaviour into reviewable specifications — durable artifacts, not chat history.

> The v1 delivery workflow (survey/extract, plan/refine/execute/finalize, target adapters) is archived at git tag `v1`; retrieve it with `git worktree add ../emery-v1 v1`. This tree carries the spec generator: `emery specify` synthesises the reviewable set from the sources named on the invocation, `emery show` renders it.

## The live surface

```bash
emery specify <adapter>...  # extract, group, synthesise spec.md + design.md
emery show spec             # print a reviewable document of the current revision
emery completions <sh>      # shell completions
```

In Cursor, `/emery:specify` wraps `emery specify`. Everything else was deleted from the grammar, not hidden — see the [CLI reference](docs/reference/cli/index.md).

Install from source:

```bash
cargo install --git https://github.com/augentic/emery --locked
emery --version
```

## Developing Emery (contributors)

The repository root is a Rust workspace producing the `emery` binary. The root `Makefile` forwards every goal to [mise](mise.toml).

```bash
make test    # native integration suite
make check   # format, lint, tests, doctests, and docs
make ci      # full pre-commit gate, including vet and deny
```

Preview the working-tree Cursor skill against a local CLI:

```bash
