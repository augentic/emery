# CLI output shapes

Canonical JSON envelope shapes for the `emery *` commands that skills shell out to. Skills should **link** to the relevant section here rather than embedding multi-line JSON examples in their `SKILL.md` body. The v1 verb catalogue is archived at git tag `v1`.

## Conventions

- `--format json` responses are a **flat body**: every successful body is a single JSON object carrying the command-specific fields **at the top level** — there is no `ok` discriminant, no `data` wrapper, and no top-level envelope-version stamp.
- Failures keep the same flat shape with three extra top-level keys:
  - `error` — a discriminant string: kebab-case for the three recovery codes (`specify-source-required`, `unsupported-version`, `spec-not-generated`), snake_case for the Omnia defaults (`bad_request`, `not_found`, `server_error`, `bad_gateway`). The discriminant is grep-stable and forms part of the public contract; see [`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md#exit-codes) for the exit-code table.
  - `message` — humanised one-liner suitable for direct rendering.
  - `exit-code` — the integer the binary returns.
- Paths are emitted as plain strings relative to the repo root unless the field name says otherwise.
- All keys are `kebab-case`. Body shapes are pinned by the typed `*Output` DTOs in `emery-engine` (`Serialize` only) and change only with the CLI's own versioning; the failure envelope is `emery-cli`'s.
- Stream roles: the semantic result body (text or JSON) is **stdout**; the failure envelope and live host tracing are **stderr**. Tracing verbosity is selected by the reserved host log flags (`--debug` / `--quiet`, peeled before the guest sees argv; see [cli-contract.md](../standards/cli-contract.md)).

## Text-mode style

Every body's render fn (its text mode, in `crates/cli/src/text.rs`) follows one convention so operators can scan any command's output the same way:

- **Result line first, lowercase, verb-first**: `committed revision 9f8e7d6c…`.
- **Detail lines are indented `label: value` pairs** with kebab-case labels: `  diff vs 1a2b3c4d: spec.md`.
- **Names in backticks**, paths bare.
- **No trailing periods** on result or detail lines.
- **`hint:` is recovery guidance** (what to fix); **`resume:` is the literal next command** (what to run). A line is one or the other, never both.
- **Every empty state prints a lowercase line** — silence is never the empty rendering.

One documented exception: `emery show` renders the document body alone in text mode — no result line — so its stdout pipes and redirects as the document itself. Its revision id rides the JSON envelope.

## Shapes

The examples below are hand-curated illustrations of the happy path; the accept/reject variant set is exercised by the integration suites under `crates/*/tests/`.

### `emery specify`

The success body names the committed revision and its reviewable set:

```json
{
  "revision": "9f8e7d6c…",
  "diff": {
    "from": "1a2b3c4d…",
    "artifacts": ["spec.md", "design.md"],
    "spec": { "added": [], "removed": [], "changed": ["session.timeout"] },
    "design": { "added": [], "removed": [], "changed": ["Domain model"] }
  }
}
```

`diff` is the re-mine diff against the superseded revision: the changed artifacts, then one `{ added, removed, changed }` object per document — `spec` lists requirement subjects (heading names, so a block that only moved is not a change), `design` lists `## ` section titles. It is absent on a first run and empty (`artifacts: []`) on a byte-stable re-run; nothing is persisted for it. Text mode prints one line per changed section prefixed by its document: `    spec.md ~ session.timeout`, `    design.md ~ Domain model`.

A pin that no longer matches the resolved bytes fails with `error: "refused"` (exit 1).

`emery specify` with no source — and no project-root `emery.toml` to discover — fails with `error: "specify-source-required"` (exit 1); mixing `--config` with positional adapters or `--description`, or naming an absolute or project-escaping local path, fails with `error: "bad_request"` (exit 1). `--config` without a value explicitly selects the project-relative `emery.toml`. A GitHub URL source fails with `error: "bad_request"`. Validation refusals from the extract gate, an adapter refusing its input (an empty brief, a tree it cannot read as one source), or a model draft (grouping, spec, or design) that still fails its check once the backend's rounds are spent, exit 1 with `error: "bad_request"` carrying the last correction and its findings; a model failure, or any other adapter failure, exits 4 with `error: "bad_gateway"` naming the source.

### `emery show <spec|design>`

The success body wraps the document with its revision id; text mode is the document body alone (see the exception above).

```json
{
  "revision": "9f8e7d6c…",
  "body": "# Specification\n…"
}
```

Before any revision is committed the verb fails with `error: "spec-not-generated"` (exit 2); a current revision id naming missing documents fails with `error: "server_error"` (exit 3).

### `emery completions <shell>`

Emits the shell completion script on stdout (no JSON envelope; the output is the script itself).

## Failure envelope

Every failing verb emits the same flat envelope on stderr:

```json
{
  "error": "specify-source-required",
  "message": "no sources",
  "exit-code": 1,
  "hint": "pass one or more adapters to `emery specify`, or add an `emery.toml` at the project root"
}
```

An optional `hint` key carries a static recovery hint when the error defines one; the `message` is transport-neutral (it names the rule, path, or adapter), and flag-vocabulary recovery text lives in the hint. Text mode prints the same envelope as `error[specify-source-required]: no sources` followed by a `hint:` line when one is defined; the discriminant is grep-stable in both formats, so a `message` never repeats it.
