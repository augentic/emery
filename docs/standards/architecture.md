# Architecture

Workspace shape, crate dependency direction, the WASI carve-out, the `.emery/` layout boundary, time injection, and the rationale behind atomic writes. Read this before adding a new crate or shifting where state lives.

## Workspace layout

Deployment crate (`name = "emery"`) at the repo root. [`src/main.rs`](../../src/main.rs) is one `omnia::runtime!` command-mode invocation over the cursor-bound backends: the engine guest is embedded as static component bytes (`include_bytes!` over `$OUT_DIR/emery.cwasm`, produced by the root `build.rs` — a child wasm32 build into an isolated target directory, then in release builds an ahead-of-time wasmtime serialize so startup deserializes instead of JIT-compiling the engine; debug builds embed the raw component and JIT at startup; there is no placeholder fallback), and `program: "emery"` forwards raw argv to the explicit `command_guest`. Deployment policy is static and CWD-rooted, expressed inline in the invocation: the invocation directory mounts as the guest's `.` (no ancestor walk — a verb run below the project root fails typed), the CWD-relative `.emery-cache` (created pre-run) backs the `GUEST_CACHE_MOUNT` preopen, and adapter guests, when present, are declared in that same invocation — a built `.wasm` path (or `include_bytes!`) plus a `/mcp/source/<name>` route, the way the journey host declares its mock source in [`examples/runtime.rs`](../../examples/runtime.rs). The shipped `src/main.rs` embeds the engine only. Dynamic admission — the `GuestResolver`, the seeded-cache and verified-store legs, the pre-bound MCP listener — is deferred until dynamic loading returns; there is no download path (ADR-0002 deletions). Every invocation — help, version, and grammar rejections included — runs in the emery guest ([`src/lib.rs`](../../src/lib.rs)) through the shared command grammar (`crates/transport`).

The authoritative leaf → root crate graph (with per-crate roles) lives in [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md). Headline shape: `diagnostics` and `artifacts` sit at the bottom; `engine` owns the domain operations (`init`, `specify`, adapter resolution); `transport` owns typed routing; the root package's `src/main.rs` owns native deployment policy inline and its wasm32 lib is the one provider (the component seam is the only production seam, ADR-0002). The journey's mock source lives in the `source` example, not a workspace crate.

There is no lint engine or `Check` substrate. Repo consistency is the mdBook links gate (`cargo make links`).

The artifact validation rule registry (`emery_artifacts::validate`) sits on `artifacts`, which depends on none of the engine crates nor anything named lint, so an artifact rule cannot reach workflow lifecycle types. `artifacts` is the lifecycle-free crate carrying the artifact types, parsers, and validation registry the engine layer reads, alongside `diagnostics` at the bottom. The neutral `Diagnostic` substrate lives in the `diagnostics` crate, so every check producer mints findings without depending on anything named `lint`.

### Engineering standards live in the adapters

There is no standards crate: engineering-standards rules (`UNI-*` and per-adapter overlays) are authored in `augentic/emery-adapters` and ship embedded in each target adapter's component, applied by its build review prompts. The "no lifecycle authority in review" rule is structural — no engine crate parses or resolves rules, so standards prose cannot reach slice or plan transitions.

Every crate uses the shared `[workspace.package]` (`edition = "2024"`, `rust-version = "1.95"`, MIT/Apache-2.0) and the shared `[workspace.lints]` block in the root `Cargo.toml` (clippy `all`/`cargo`/`nursery`/`pedantic` warned, plus a hand-picked `restriction` subset and a tightened rust lint set — `missing_debug_implementations`, `single_use_lifetimes`, `redundant_lifetimes`).

**Hard dependency rule:** `diagnostics` depends on no other workspace crate. `artifacts` depends only on `diagnostics` among workspace crates. Adding a workspace dep that re-introduces a cycle is the layering the tests exist to catch; do not.

**New workspace crates** are an exception, not the default.

The `source` example (`examples/source.rs`) is the one mock source adapter: a `emery_adapter::Source` implementor exported as the journey's seam fixture. The journey binds that one adapter. It carries no production lifecycle authority and never enters the shipped guest. Do not add another mock adapter — extend this example.

## Deployment: the Wasm guest

There is no hand-written provider. The engine's only remaining provider capability is the model (`omnia_guest::Model`, WASI-backed defaults); the guest declares a bare unit for it at the composition root (`src/lib.rs`). Everything the deleted `Provider` used to carry is structural now: paths are fixed constants relative to named preopens (`emery_engine::handler::ExecutionPaths::deployed()`), and adapter dispatch — `extract` and `metadata` — rides the `emery:adapter/source` WIT imports directly from the engine's cfg-gated dispatch functions (typed refusals on native, where no seam exists). The native provider was deleted at the Phase 3 spine cut (ADR-0002: "deleted, not demoted"); integration coverage runs over the component seam via the dev-only journey host, while pure kernels test natively over injected runners and scripted inputs.

The root `emery` package carries the Omnia deployment unit under `src/`: the guest cdylib (`src/lib.rs`, the `wasi:cli/run` exporter and `wasi:http/incoming-handler` — the latter answers every mutating path with `emery_transport::http`'s typed refusal, C3 — plus the bare model provider) and the shipped runtime (`src/main.rs`, one `omnia::runtime!` invocation embedding the engine bytes). Commands live in `engine` as transport-neutral `Operation<P>` implementations beside their domain kernels (shared plumbing in `emery_engine::handler`). `crates/transport/src/command.rs` owns the explicit typed command route inventory over `Invoker<P>`; the WASI and native shims only construct invokers and adapt transport output. The routing design is documented in [handler-shape.md](handler-shape.md).

## Domain modules of note

- **`crates/engine/src/resolve/`** — source-adapter resolution over the typed `AdapterSelector`: the `resolver::Component` kernel (read-only re-resolution) and the `ensure` kernels (the provisioning leg, one component, no manifest). Operations call them directly over the deployed metadata dispatch (`metadata::deployed` — the WIT `metadata` import on wasm32, a typed refusal natively), injecting `jiff::Timestamp::now()` at the operation boundary. `Component` keeps its injected `Runner`, the native kernel-test seam. Non-identity metadata is cached against the component digest.
- **`crates/artifacts/src/evidence.rs`** — the typed Evidence `Document` / `Claim` wire shapes (mirroring the WIT `evidence` / `claim` records) and their deterministic validation (`Document::validate`: kebab grammars, the per-kind claim id requirement). The typed serde parse is the load gate for every on-disk artifact; validators return `omnia_guest::Error::new` with `ErrorKind::BadRequest` and a kebab `code` so the CLI exits 2 (`Exit::ValidationFailed`) with that discriminant as the wire `error`.

The lenient v1 module trees in `artifacts` (spec parsers, provenance, the task/decision/leads validators) were deleted at the Phase 3 spine cut and are documented at tag `v1`.

## Adapter component resolution

`resolver::Component` dispatches identities by routed id (the WIT `metadata` export) and probes the project component cache first for bare names and persisted component selectors (`<project-cache>/components/<name>.wasm`, mirrored at init from an operator-supplied local file). Under the shipped static deployment a dispatch lands only on a guest declared in the runtime invocation; anything else fails at the dispatch seam. The dynamic legs (seeded-cache answer, verified global-store entry, resolve-on-miss) are deferred with the resolver; there is no download path and no sibling-checkout or build-tree probe. Roots are fixed constants relative to the named preopens, carried as the `Locations` formulas threaded through `ExecutionPaths::deployed()` — the same strings resolve against the wasm32 preopen table and the native invocation directory. A binding names the axis; a component bound on the wrong axis fails at the dispatch seam — no deployed guest exports the requested `<axis>:<name>` id.

## WASI carve-outs

The two adapter validators — `contract` and `vectis` — are in-guest adapter library code compiled into each adapter's published component in `augentic/emery-adapters`. The carve-out discipline (leaner lint posture and minimal `[workspace.dependencies]`) lives in that repo's workspace. Crux shell presence and launcher-icon heuristics live in the vectis adapter's in-guest core: the host performs no plan-time shell detection, so this repo carries no shell-detect crate.

**Host runner invariant.** The host CLI dispatches no adapter-owned tool: adapter validation, scaffold, and rendering logic lives entirely in the adapters repo as in-guest library code. There is no declared-tool surface. No `emery-*` workspace crate may import adapter-specific validation, scaffold, or rendering logic.

## Layout boundary

`.emery/` is framework-managed state every CLI verb writes through. Two owners cover it: `emery_engine::project::Project::path` for `project.yaml`, and `emery_engine::home::Home` for the spec output home (generation directories plus the `current` pointer). Do not hard-code `.emery/` paths elsewhere; a new `.emery/` path lands on one of those owners.

## Time injection

Functions that record a timestamp into a serialised artifact accept `now: jiff::Timestamp` from the operation boundary. Domain kernels do not call `Timestamp::now()`; operation call sites inject time so tests can pin it deterministically.

## Atomic writes

Use `yaml_write` (in `crates/artifacts/src/atomic.rs`) for any file a concurrent reader may observe mid-write (e.g. `project.yaml`). It serialises to `NamedTempFile::new_in(parent)` and `persist`-renames over the target so readers either see the prior bytes or the new bytes. Plain `fs::write` is reserved for files no other process reads concurrently with the writer (one-shot scratch output, fixtures inside a tempdir test).

The standards-side phrasing of the rule lives in [coding-standards.md §"YAML, JSON, and atomic writes"](./coding-standards.md#yaml-json-and-atomic-writes).

## Toolchain

Rust stable per `rust-toolchain.toml` (channel `stable`, components `clippy`, `rust-src`, `rustfmt`). WASM targets pre-installed via `targets = ["aarch64-apple-darwin", "wasm32-wasip2", "x86_64-apple-darwin"]`.

`rustfmt.toml` uses unstable nightly features (`unstable_features = true`, `imports_granularity = "Module"`, `group_imports = "StdExternalCrate"`). Format with nightly:

```bash
cargo +nightly fmt --all
```

`cargo make fmt` does this for you.

## Supply chain

`cargo-vet` and `cargo-deny` gate `cargo make ci`; `cargo-audit`, `cargo-outdated`, and `cargo-udeps` are advisory tasks run on demand (`cargo make audit` / `outdated` / `deps`). The vet task is check-only (`cargo vet --locked`) — regeneration is deliberately not part of the gate, since regenerating exemptions before checking would auto-exempt anything unaudited. When a new dependency lands:

1. Add it to `[workspace.dependencies]` in the root `Cargo.toml` with a major-version pin (e.g. `serde = { version = "1", features = ["derive"] }`). Per-crate `Cargo.toml` references it as `serde.workspace = true`.
2. Run `cargo vet regenerate imports`, `cargo vet regenerate exemptions`, and `cargo vet regenerate unpublished`; review the `supply-chain/` diff, then commit it.
3. Check `deny.toml` allows the dependency's licence. The current allowlist is in `deny.toml`; add a new SPDX id only after confirming compatibility with MIT-OR-Apache-2.0.

`clippy::multiple_crate_versions` is silenced workspace-wide (`Cargo.toml`'s `[workspace.lints.clippy]`); duplicate transitive versions are audited by hand via `cargo tree --duplicates` on each `cargo update`, not gated through a ratchet.

## Skill / CLI responsibility split

Every deterministic operation lives in this CLI: kebab-case validation, project scaffolding, adapter resolution and caching, and schema validation. The surviving `/emery:init` skill shells out for all of those.

The corollary: when a skill currently does something deterministic in prose (parsing YAML, validating shape, transitioning state), the right fix is to add a CLI verb here and have the skill call it. The wrong fix is to make the skill smarter.

[`AGENTS.md`](../../AGENTS.md) is the source of truth for vocabulary and the crate map.
