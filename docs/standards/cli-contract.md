# CLI Contract

The deterministic surface skills depend on. The surviving skill in this repository (`/emery:specify`) shells out to the `emery` binary; it is an ultrathin wrapper over one verb. The v1 workflow verbs and their skills are archived at git tag `v1`.

The CLI itself is built in the in-tree Cargo workspace at the repo root: the `emery-cli` crate (`crates/cli`) owns the grammar over the transport-neutral `emery-engine` operations, and omnia's command façade (`omnia_guest::api::command`) owns the envelope and the exit contract. This document captures the verbs skills call, the envelope shape they consume, and pointers to the authoritative wire-contract definitions.

## Rule: all deterministic operations live in the CLI

Skills are ultrathin invoke-and-relay wrappers: they elicit missing arguments, invoke one `emery` verb, and relay its output. Skill markdown must not grow orchestration, synthesis, or validation prose.

When a skill currently does something deterministic in prose (parsing YAML, validating shape, transitioning state), the right fix is to add a CLI verb and have the skill call it. The wrong fix is to make the skill smarter. See [AGENTS.md](../../AGENTS.md).

Never hand-edit `.omnia/storage` state (the revision store); never `mkdir -p .omnia/...`. Route through the CLI — it enforces the legal set of states and validates inputs in one place for humans, agents, and CI alike.

## Verb tree

- `emery specify <adapter>... [--description <adapter>=<text>] [--config [<path>]]` — the spec generator: resolve the sources named on the invocation (a project-relative local component loads through the deployment loader, read fresh each run; an exact package reference fetches from the source's `registry` override or the compiled-in default endpoint; either load's optional `digest` pin is verified host-side), extract, derive the requirements, synthesise, and commit `spec.md` / `design.md` as one revision, atomically swapping the current revision id. `--config` without a value selects the project-relative `emery.toml`; a run naming no sources at all discovers the project-root `emery.toml` as a fallback, never merged with argv sources. The source list is per-run input, never persisted. Invoked without a source — and with nothing to discover — it exits `1` with `specify-source-required`; mixing `--config` with argv sources, or naming a filesystem path outside the `.` project preopen, exits `1` with `bad_request`.
- `emery show <spec|design>` — print a reviewable document of the current revision; text stdout is the Markdown projection alone, and the JSON envelope carries the typed document as `document`. Before any commit it fails `spec-not-generated` (exit `2`); a revision under an older grammar fails `spec-outdated` (exit `1`).
- `emery completions <shell>` — auto-derived shell completions over the live clap surface.

## JSON envelope

Every CLI verb that skills consume emits a stable **flat body**: the command-specific fields at the top level of a single JSON object. On success the body is exactly that — there is no `ok` discriminant, no `data` wrapper around the payload, and no top-level envelope-version stamp. On failure the flat object carries three top-level keys: `error` (a discriminant string: kebab-case for the four recovery codes, snake_case for Omnia defaults), `message` (a humanised one-liner), and `exit-code` (the integer the binary returns). Skills invoked with `--format json` parse the body and branch on the `error` field rather than on stdout text.

Stream roles are part of the contract: the semantic result body (text or JSON) is stdout; the failure body and live host tracing are stderr. The failure body carries no styling in either format; colour policy belongs to the host tracing layer alone. Host tracing is selected by the reserved host log flags, peeled from argv before the guest sees it: bare invocations default to INFO progress, `--quiet` turns tracing off, and `--debug` adds backend debug tracing (both flags win over any ambient `RUST_LOG`). Skills follow the plugin rule's tracing contract and relay the semantic result once without repeating tracing lines.

The canonical envelope shapes live in [docs/reference/cli-output-shapes.md](../reference/cli-output-shapes.md). SKILL.md bodies **link** to that reference rather than embedding envelope JSON inline (house style applied in review).

The `error` discriminants are part of the public contract that skills and tests grep for. Examples skills handle today:

- `specify-source-required` — `emery specify` without a source and with no project-root `emery.toml` to discover.
- `spec-not-generated` — `emery show` before any revision is committed.
- `unsupported-version` — an adapter's declared minimum `emery-version` is newer than the running binary.
- `spec-outdated` — the stored revision was written under an older grammar than the running binary reads; regenerate.
- `refused` — the loader rejected the request: a mismatched or malformed `digest` pin, an invalid component, a missing source-seam export, or a location kind this deployment does not serve; the message names which.
- `unavailable` — the deployment's acquirer could not produce a registry package (network, endpoint, or a missing exact version); check connectivity and the source's `registry` override.

## Exit codes

The CLI uses the Omnia 1:1 exit map; the one table lives in [`AGENTS.md` § Exit codes](../../AGENTS.md#exit-codes). Two notes for skills: on `unsupported-version` (exit `1`), tell the operator to update the installed binary through its install channel; exit `64` carries clap's own usage text on stderr and no JSON envelope — a skill that sees it has built a bad argv.

Skills should branch on the exit code first (success vs failure class) and on the four kebab recovery discriminants second (`specify-source-required`, `unsupported-version`, `spec-not-generated`, `spec-outdated`). Other failures share the Omnia snake_case default for that class (`bad_request`, `not_found`, `server_error`, `bad_gateway`). New exit codes are not invented by skills or the CLI.
