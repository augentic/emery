//! The source adapter contract
//!
//! The agreement between the Emery engine and every source adapter: the
//! `emery:adapter/source` WIT world, the Rust types that mirror its records,
//! the rules a claim must satisfy, and the [`Source`] capability the engine
//! calls adapters through.
//!
//! Both sides depend on this one crate so they cannot drift apart. The engine
//! consumes it directly; adapters receive it re-exported through the
//! `emery-adapter` SDK.
