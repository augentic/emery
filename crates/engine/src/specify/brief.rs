//! Briefs
//!
//! One judgment put to the model: what the engine asks, how it steers the
//! answer, and what it accepts. A brief carries a run's facts, names the
//! prose that instructs the model, renders the turn, tightens the answer's
//! derived schema to the run, and verifies every candidate against the facts;
//! only an answer it accepts becomes output — rows or a document — and the
//! brief alone produces that output.
//!
//! The model is never asked for anything the engine can decide itself, and
//! nothing the engine renders comes from an unchecked answer.
