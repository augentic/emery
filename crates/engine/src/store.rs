//! The revision store
//!
//! Where committed specifications live. A revision is the `spec.md` and
//! `design.md` pair one `specify` run produced; the store commits a new
//! revision, reads the current one, and reports how it differs from the one
//! it replaced.
//!
//! A revision is identified by the digest of its content, never a sequence
//! number, so the same documents always have the same id and a document that
//! no longer matches its id is recognised as corruption. Only the current
//! revision is kept, which keeps the store small and its meaning simple.
