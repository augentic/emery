//! Evidence answers
//!
//! The one model call an adapter makes: [`evidence`] asks the extract
//! question as an [`Evidence`]-typed [`Question`] and returns the accepted
//! document. [`content_note`] is the prompt fragment that tells the model
//! what it was bound to.
//!
//! The schema steers the answer's shape but cannot express every rule a
//! claim must satisfy, so each candidate the backend proposes is run through
//! the contract's claim gate before it is accepted; a miss goes back to the
//! model as findings and the backend asks again. The engine re-runs the same
//! gate on receipt, but an adapter that checks in place rarely hands it
//! evidence to reject.
