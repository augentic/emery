//! Source adapter SDK
//!
//! Everything an adapter author needs to build an Emery source adapter: the
//! [`SourceAdapter`] trait to implement, the [`evidence`] call that asks the
//! extract question, the [`content_note`] prompt fragment, and the export
//! macro that turns an implementation into a wasm component.
//!
//! The contract itself lives in `emery-source` and is re-exported here, so an
//! adapter depends on one crate and never sees the wire bindings directly.
//! Failures are omnia's [`Error`]: an adapter refuses its input with
//! [`bad_request!`] and reports anything else with the sibling macros.
