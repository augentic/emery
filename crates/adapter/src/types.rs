//! Adapter types
//!
//! The data types an adapter works with: the contract DTOs re-exported from
//! `emery-source`, and the [`Context`] describing the environment one
//! `extract` call runs in — which adapter was addressed, where the project
//! is mounted, which reference documents are available, and whether the
//! model may read the workspace.
//!
//! Gathering these in one module gives adapter code a single import path
//! regardless of which crate defines each type.
