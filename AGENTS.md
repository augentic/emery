# Emery - Agent Instructions

> **Remediation programme in flight.** Before starting any task, read [`CONSTITUTION.md`](CONSTITUTION.md) (standing invariants). This file maps the reduced Phase 0 tree — what exists after the freeze, never a spec of what to build. Feature work is frozen until the spec walking skeleton is green.
>
> The v1 implementation (survey + extract, plan/refine/execute, target adapters, the definition loop) is archived at git tag `v1`; retrieve it with `git worktree add ../emery-v1 v1`. First-party adapters live in [`augentic/emery-adapters`](https://github.com/augentic/emery-adapters) — re-seamed extract-only in Phase 4 (its `v1` tag keeps the survey-era tree).

## What this repository is now

A Rust workspace at the repository root producing the `emery` runtime binary, plus one Cursor plugin (`plugins/emery/` carrying the `/emery:init` skill wrapper). The live CLI grammar is three verbs:

- `emery init <adapter>... [--value <adapter>=<text>]` — scaffold `.emery/`, resolve/cache each source adapter, write the `sources:` bindings on `project.yaml` (ADR-0009 §1; `--upgrade` is the re-entry path).
- `emery specify` — the spec generator (ADR-0008 §3, ADR-0009): extract every source binding over the adapter seam, reconcile under authority precedence, synthesise, and commit `spec.md` / `design.md` as one generation behind the swapped `current` pointer. A re-run reports the re-mine diff against the superseded generation in the success envelope — never persisted (ADR-0010).
- `emery completions <shell>` — auto-derived from the clap surface.

Deleted verbs are deleted from the grammar, not hidden — there are no compatibility aliases or deprecated stubs. The guest's mutating HTTP catch-all remains a typed refusal (C3, `crates/transport/src/http.rs`); the pre-bound listener serves adapter MCP shelves only.

## Vocabulary

- **source adapter** — input role: one WebAssembly component exporting the WIT `source-adapter` world (`extract` + `metadata`; no manifest file). `extract` takes a typed `SourceInput` (`key`, workspace-or-value) and returns an Evidence document of typed claims — the spec IR (A8/A16; required extras are fail-closed engine-side, ADR-0009 §3). Survey, leads, and the target axis were deleted from the seam (archived at `v1`); see [wit/emery.wit](wit/emery.wit).
- **engine** — this product: the engine guest (`emery:engine`), the surviving engine crates, and the seam opposite adapters.
- **plugin** (adapter vocabulary) vs **Cursor plugins** — do not confuse the adapter noun with `plugins/emery/`, the IDE distribution surface for the `/emery:init` skill wrapper; the latter is invisible to the `emery` CLI.

Artifact authority is unchanged in spirit: when authoritative inputs are incomplete, preserve the gap as `[unknown]` rather than guessing.

## The Rust workspace

Leaf → root. Each publishing package is `emery-<crate>` on crates.io; Rust `use` paths follow the package name (`emery_engine::`, `emery_artifacts::`, …). Failures are `omnia_guest::Error`. The root package stays `publish = false`.

```text
diagnostics  # leaf — Diagnostic substrate + emery_diagnostics::digest (SHA-256)
artifacts    # artifact types + parsers (evidence, atomic writer, validate registry); no engine deps
adapter      # the adapter SDK — the Source operations trait (extract + metadata), the WIT package + source! export macro, the engine guest's source::import seam wrappers, seam DTOs, embedded prose registry
engine       # the spec generator — project model + source bindings, init + specify operations, extract leg (required-extras gate) over the WIT source imports, reconcile/synthesise (embedded synthesis prose), the generation-pointer output home; plus the ported kernels: emery_engine::resolve (resolver::Component, ensure, metadata::deployed) and emery_engine::handler (RequestContext, preopen-relative ExecutionPaths/Locations, Render)
transport    # typed command router over Invoker: init + specify + completions, exhaustive TryFrom conversions, projectors, exit contract, HTTP refusal (C3)
prose        # build-dependency crate — embed-time prompt-corpus walk + link check
emery (root) # Omnia deployment unit under src/: wasm32 engine guest cdylib (src/lib.rs — bare model provider, wasi:cli/run, HTTP refusal) + shipped runtime (src/main.rs, one omnia::runtime! embedding $OUT_DIR/emery.cwasm; static, CWD-rooted deployment policy inline — the invocation directory mounts as `.`, the CWD-relative .emery-cache backs the cache preopen; adapter guests are declared in the runtime invocation; dynamic resolution is deferred)
```

### Repository map

```text
src/               shipped binary (omnia::runtime!, static CWD-rooted deployment) + wasm32 engine guest cdylib (bare model provider, wasi:cli/run, HTTP refusal)
crates/            the workspace crates above
examples/          source adapter (guest + adapter) + runtime host (root-package examples; ADR-0009 §5)
wit/               the emery:adapter WIT package (source-adapter world) + README
plugins/emery/     Cursor plugin: /emery:init skill wrapper, rules, manifest

```

### Exit codes

`Exit::from(&Error)` in [`crates/transport/src/command/output.rs`](./crates/transport/src/command/output.rs) is the single source of truth.

| Code | Name | When |
| ---- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| 0 | `EXIT_SUCCESS` | Command succeeded. |
| 1 | `EXIT_GENERIC_FAILURE` | Any error that is not `ErrorKind::BadRequest` (I/O, YAML, `not-initialized`, floor failures `emery-version-too-old` / `adapter-cli-too-old`, …). |
| 2 | `EXIT_VALIDATION_FAILED` | `ErrorKind::BadRequest` (validation, argument) and clap usage. |

## Testing philosophy

Emery strictly enforces an **aggressive integration-first posture**:

- Design against the public surface: if a behavior is reachable through a CLI input or `pub` fn and observable at a public boundary (stdout JSON, exit code, filesystem), write the integration test in `crates/<name>/tests/`; the unit test is redundant. Wire-contract coverage lives in `crates/transport/tests/`.
- Default to deletion; do not widen public APIs to test private kernels. `CRATE=<crate> cargo make cov` is the brake.
- One fast rung: native kernel and wire-contract suites (`cargo make test`, per push) — pure engine kernels over scripted models, transport grammar/parity over an inert provider. The wasm32 guest is compile-checked (`cargo check --lib -p emery --target wasm32-wasip2`); the v1 eval and wasm-example rungs are archived at `v1`.
- One seam rung: the walking-skeleton journey (`cargo make journey`, [`tests/journey.rs`](tests/journey.rs)) drives the journey host (the shipped runtime shape with a scripted model, ADR-0009 §5) over the built mock components — the one integration rung since the T10 spine cut (ADR-0002 §2) and the Phase 3 exit criterion, green and required in CI in its own job; excluded from `cargo make test` by the nextest `default-filter`. Do not weaken its assertions.

See [`docs/standards/testing.md`](docs/standards/testing.md).

## Commands

All from the repository root, driven by `cargo make` ([`Makefile.toml`](./Makefile.toml)). Run the full local gate before committing; do not rely on bare `cargo test` or `cargo clippy`.

```bash
cargo make ci     # fmt + lint + test + test-docs + doc + links + vet + deny
cargo make check  # the pre-commit subset (cargo make fmt fixes formatting)
cargo make links  # Developer Guide link integrity (mdbook build docs, mdbook-linkcheck2)
cargo make test   # cargo nextest run --locked --workspace --all-features --no-tests=pass, under -Dwarnings
cargo make lint   # cargo clippy --locked --workspace --all-targets --all-features -- -D warnings
cargo make fmt    # nightly cargo fmt --all
cargo make journey        # walking-skeleton rung over the component seam (required CI job)
cargo make source         # build the journey's mock source component (wasm32-wasip2, release)
```

## Gotchas

- **Adapter admission is static.** `emery init <adapter>` accepts a package reference (`emery:intent@1.0.0`), the first-party shorthand (`intent@1.0.0`), a bare name, or a local `.wasm` path — but until the dynamic resolver returns, dispatch lands only on guests declared in the runtime invocation (`src/main.rs`; the journey host declares its mock `source` the same way in `examples/runtime.rs`). A local `.wasm` still mirrors into the project cache at init; extract dispatch beyond the declared set fails at the seam. There is no download path (ADR-0002 §2), and GitHub URLs are refused (`adapter-github-uri-unsupported`).
- Never hand-edit `project.yaml` or the component cache; never `mkdir -p .emery/...`. Route through the CLI.
- `cargo make links` enforces Developer Guide link integrity — renaming docs paths requires updating links in the same change.
- Crossing a major is a hard cut: no silent compatibility aliases and no migration framework. Pre-1.0, a major bump means re-init.
- Brevity caps are mechanically enforced by root-crate tests (`tests/ident_brevity.rs`, `tests/doc_brevity.rs`, part of `cargo make test`), alongside the crate-DAG gate (`tests/layering.rs`).

- Lint suppressions: refactor first; `#[expect(lint, reason = "…")]` at the smallest scope; state in the PR why a refactor was infeasible.
- When you remove a symbol, `rg <SymbolName> -- AGENTS.md docs/` and update every hit in the same PR.
- Markdown changes follow [doc-authoring.md](docs/standards/doc-authoring.md); do not hard-wrap prose solely for column width.

Run `cargo make ci` before committing. If it cannot run, say exactly why and which checks were run instead.
